//This is the first line of our code.
//For example, if our programs needs mathematical operations of high level them we must include:

#include <math.h>
int main()
// from here program begins
//this is the 2nd line.
//int is the return type of function and the return type is according to the functions activity
{
int a;
    printf("hello world");
//simply a print statement.
///n is the new line character here.
  scanf("%d",&a);
 //scanf is used to take inputs from the user
 return 0;
 //Return 0 means that the function is working perfectly.

Keywords -are reserved words
Identifiers-names given to variables or functions
Note: C is a case sensitive language so an identifier containing a capital letter and another one containing a small letter at the same place will be different
Constants -difference between constant and variable is that a constant’s value never changes
String Literal - a line of characters enclosed by double quotes
Symbols - special characters reserved to perform certain actions

//Variables & Data Types In C
/*
- We cannot declare a variable without specifying its data type.

//Operators In C
/*
- Special symbols that are used to perform actions or operations are known as operators.”
>Arithmetic operators 
-are used to perform mathematical operations such as
 addition, subtraction etc
 >Relational operators 
 -are used for the comparison between two or more numbers
> There are three logical operators
- i.e. AND, OR and NOT. 
> Assignment operators are used to assign values.
